LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell ProgramCounter0/AddSubSelect_reg_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous reset pin(s) InstructionDecoder0/AddSubSelect_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell ProgramCounter0/JumpFlag_reg_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous reset pin(s) InstructionDecoder0/JumpFlag_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#3 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell ProgramCounter0/LoadSelect_reg_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous reset pin(s) InstructionDecoder0/LoadSelect_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
